                    <h2>Andy Samberg</h2>
                    <h4>as Jacob "Jake" Peralta</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Jake is a skilled detective, but often acts immaturely. His favorite film is Die Hard, which he references frequently and even attempts to relive. He is also an obsessive fan of Taylor Swift's music and Nicolas Cage's movies. Jake is unrelenting in his confidence, even in the face of failure, and refuses to take things seriously most of the time. He dates and later marries Amy and they have a son in season 7. He often references his hard upbringing due to his father leaving him as a child. He sees Captain Raymond Holt as a father figure. He often seems to not care about precautions and the job, but he is very skilled and constantly takes down criminals. In the final episode he leaves his job to look after his son.</p>

                    <h4>as Amy Santiago</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Amy is a neurotic, competitive, "nerdy" detective who desperately seeks Captain Holt's approval. She obsesses over mistakes and is eager to prove herself worthy. She becomes a sergeant in season 5. Although very different people, she and Jake begin to date in season 3, get married in season 5, and have a son named Mac after the fictional John McClane at the end of season 7. In the final episode she becomes a chief and heads a new police reform program with Holt.</p>

                    <h2>Stephanie Beatriz</h2>
                    <h4>as Rosa Diaz</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Rosa is a tough, intimidating detective; most of the 99th precinct is afraid of her. She takes pride in being very private and her colleagues know almost nothing about her, including what she likes or where she lives. She used to do ballet and gymnastics as a child and is skilled with various weapons. She also went to medical school, as well as business school, and even has a pilot license. New, unexpected information is commonly revealed about her. At the police academy, she was classmates with Jake and the two became friends. In seasons 3 and 4, she dates fellow detective Adrian Pimento, and she comes out as bisexual later in season 5. In the final season she has left her job, in the wake of BLM, becoming a private detective and help those targeted by crooked cops.</p>

                    <h2>Chelsea Peretti</h2>
                    <h4>as Regina "Gina" Linetti</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Gina is Captain Holt's assistant and Jake's childhood friend. She acts cool and uninterested in the people around her, instead focusing almost entirely on her phone and social media. Gina is over-confident to the point of arrogance and holds an unproven amount of respect for her peers. She loves dancing and making fun of Amy. She also has a short-lived sexual relationship with Charles, which she is incredibly ashamed of, though she later goes public with the relationship, without consulting Charles. In season 5, she has a child named Enigma/"Iggy" with Charles's cousin. Gina departs temporarily at the start of season 5 for maternity leave to care for Iggy (this was written to coincide with Peretti's real-life pregnancy), and for good in season 6 to build an online brand, but she returns in the series finale.</p>

                    <h4>as Charles Boyle</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Charles is Jake's best friend who is obsessed with strange and unusual food. He most often partners with Jake, whom he holds in high regard, and tends to over-share personal and intimate information with him. Early in season 1, he has an intense crush on Rosa and often tries to ask her out but fails. After a brief engagement to food author Vivian Ludley, he later begins a relationship with an artist named Genevieve and the two adopt a son named Nikolaj from Latvia at the start of season 4.</p>

                    <h4>as Terrence "Terry" Jeffords</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Terry is a family man with a wife, Sharon, and twin daughters, Cagney and Lacey, having a third daughter in season 3 on Thanksgiving named Ava. He works out frequently and is very strong, but used to be extremely overweight and still has some issues with food displayed through his almost obsessive love of yoghurt. For the first five seasons, he is a sergeant, being addressed as "Sarge" frequently. In season 6, he passes an exam to become a lieutenant. In the series finale, he becomes the captain of the Nine-Nine. He cares deeply about the Nine-Nine and is always there for his detectives.</p>

                    <h4>as Raymond Holt</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Captain Holt is the captain of the 99th precinct who takes pride in being the NYPD's first black gay police captain. He is known for his stoic and deadpan demeanor and he frequently criticizes Jake's immature behavior, though he eventually develops a strong, familial relationship with all his detectives, who in turn hold him in high esteem. Both Amy and Jake view him as a father figure. He is married to Kevin Cozner (portrayed by Marc Evan Jackson), a professor of classics at Columbia University, and has a Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Cheddar. He is rivals with Deputy Chief (Commissioner) Madeline Wuntch. In the final episode he is promoted to deputy commissioner to run a police reform program with Amy in the wake of BLM and the behaviour of cops over lockdown.</p>

                    <h4>as Norm Scully</h4>
                    <br>
                    <p>Scully and Hitchcock are two aging, accident-prone, lazy, and non-proficient detectives whose careers peaked in the 1980s. They are best-friends and state their ideas are each others. They now focus more on paperwork, making coffee, and eating junk food. Because of this, they are often disregarded by the rest of the precinct, but they are quite skilled when they put their minds to it, occasionally being used for missions and helping out. Hitchcock is vulgar and crass, especially towards women, and lives in a van; Scully is more kindhearted and sweet and can sing opera well despite suffering from numerous medical maladies. Their personal lives are rather disturbing and random including affairs, frequent hospital visits and depressing familial dynamics.</p>
