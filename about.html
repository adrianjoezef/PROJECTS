                        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>Brooklyn Nine-Nine is an American police procedural comedy television series that aired on Fox, and later on NBC, from September 17, 2013 to September 16, 2021, for eight seasons and 153 episodes. Created by Dan Goor and Michael Schur, it revolves around seven New York City Police Department (NYPD) detectives who are adjusting to life under their new commanding officer, the serious and stern Captain Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher). This sitcom features an ensemble cast of Andre Braugher, Andy Samberg, Stephanie Beatriz, Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Joe Lo Truglio, Chelsea Peretti, Dirk Blocker, and Joel McKinnon Miller.</p>

                        <h3>SEASONS & EPISODES</h3>
                        <p>Fox originally ordered 13 episodes of the single-camera comedy for its first season, eventually expanding it to 22 episodes. Brooklyn Nine-Nine premiered on September 17, 2013. On May 10, 2018, Fox cancelled it after five seasons; the next day, NBC picked it up for a sixth season, which premiered on January 10, 2019. The seventh season premiered in February 2020. The 10-episode eighth and final season premiered on August 12, 2021.</p>

                        <h3>PRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>Writers and producers Michael Schur and Dan Goor, who had known each other since they were students at Harvard University, and had collaborated on the sitcom Parks and Recreation, conceived the idea to set a comedy in a police station, a setting they felt had been insufficiently used in television comedies since Barney Miller. They pitched the idea to production company Universal Television, where Schur had a development deal. Although Universal signed on to produce the series, its parent company's network, NBC, passed on airing it, so the duo sold it to the Fox Broadcasting Company.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The exterior view of the fictional 99th Precinct building was the actual 78th Precinct building in Brooklyn. If the 99th Precinct were real, it would be considered a Brooklyn police precinct (where numbers can theoretically range from 60 to 99), but no precinct has yet been assigned number "99".</p>

                        <h3>AWARDS</h3>
                        <p>The series has been acclaimed by critics. The first season won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy, and on the same night, Samberg won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy. Braugher was nominated four times for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and twice won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. The series also received particular praise for its portrayal of serious issues while retaining a sense of humour. For its portrayal of LGBTQ+ characters, it won the 2018 GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series.</p>
